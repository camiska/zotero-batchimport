# Batch-Import Plugin for Zotero 7+/8

Batch-import files from a folder (if you want to also including subfolders) or select them directly, mirror subfolders as subcollections, trigger metadata retrieval and optionally tag items that are duplicates to existing attachments.

## Features

- Configurable: Select a folder and import all PDFs, EPUBs, HTMLs or all file types supported by zotero into a new collection
- Configurable: include subfolders
- Configurable: mirror subfolders as subcollections
- Configurable: tag imported duplicates as `batchimportdupe`
- Configurable: Triggering retrieval of metadata (no idea if this is even needed, I just wanted to make sure)
- Configurable: Adding the Batch-Import function as a button to your toolbar. By default it will be an option in your Tools menu

## Requirements

- Zotero 7+/8

## Install

- Download the latest `.xpi` from the Releases page of https://github.com/camiska/zotero-batchimport
- In Zotero: Tools > Add-ons > Gear icon > Install Add-on From File > select the XPI

I was always using zotero-folder-import, but since it wasn't updated for 8 and I needed to organize my research things that was only in local folders, I wrote this. I am in no means a professional, so please feel free to point out any errors or feedback.
